                I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, 
                supervised jointly by Prof. Simon Levin in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Prof. 
                Naomi Leonard in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. 
                I received my PhD in Applied Physics from Harvard University in Prof. Vinny Manoharanâ€™s group, 
                where I was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). 
                I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the University of Notre Dame.

                My PhD work was centered on structural color, a type of color that comes from light's interaction with nanoscale structures
                instead of from pigments. This phenomenon is present in coloration throughout nature, from bird feathers and butterfly wings
                to plants and gemstones. I deeply enjoyed the day-to-day process of working through the mysteries in this field by making 
                samples, measuring their optical properties, and building models to make sense of the data. In particular, I was captivated by
                the process of examining reproducible, yet unexplained, signatures in data, and hunting for a well-reasoned, testable explanation.

                During my graduate studies, I was drawn to topics with broad applications outside of light scattering, 
                such as self-organization and the characterization of order and disorder. 
                I eventually realized that the questions that fascinated and motivated me were outside of traditional physics altogether; 
                In my free time, I was reading books about human social systems and collective action. 
                I applied to a fellowship from NSF Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) that would allow me to visit 
                the University of Oslo for eight months during my PhD. There, I pursued a project in understanding which social 
                interventions were most effective at mitigating the spread of Covid. I decided to continue studying human systems in my postdoc, 
                which is how I ended up at Princeton studying collective behavior online.
