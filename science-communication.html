                My interest in writing started with short stories. For the past few years, most of my writing has been about science, 
                whether through papers, communication pieces, or talks. I try to see all of these as forms of storytelling, an approach I picked up from
                mentors and from books on science writing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2017, I co-founded <a href="softbites.org" target="_blank" class="text-link">Softbites</a>, a science communication blog that explains soft matter physics papers at an early undergraduate level.
                During my years as managing editor, I guided pieces through our editorial process, edited many myself, and occasionally contributed my own.  
                I later led several semester-long science communication workshops at Harvard, 
                and was invited to write an article for <i>Physics Today</i>, linked below.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here is a selection of articles I've written, as well as a "science as art" project I did for fun.
