                        Light scattering in hierarchical disordered structures

                Photonic balls—microscopic spheres containing nanoparticle or nanopore assemblies—offer way to create 
                pigments with vibrant, angle-independent structural colors. These particles can be dispersed in liquids,
                 making them ideal for applications like paints and coatings. Dispersions or films of photonic balls can 
                 be seen as hierarchical structures, with nanostructures inside the spheres and then packings of these 
                 spheres. These two scales of structure lead to two scales of light scattering behavior. Inside the photonic
                  balls, light scatters differently than it does between them. To predict colors from these structures and
                   capture both scales of scattering, we developed a multiscale model that simulates light scattering at 
                   both the individual sphere and film levels. Our findings reveal that photonic balls scatter light 
                   differently than homogeneous nanostructures, often reducing color saturation. Using predictions from 
                   our model validated with data, we demonstrate that a solution to this reduction in saturation is to 
                   embed absorbers within the spheres and refine surface roughness. These findings unlock new design 
                   possibilities for structural color materials.
