                My interest in writing started with short stories. For the past ten years, most of my writing has been about science, 
                whether through papers or communication pieces. Over time, I've tried to see writing science as a form of storytelling, 
                which is the advice I've heard from the scientists whose writing I admire most. 
                <br>
                <br>
                With a small group of researchers from different institutions, I co-founded a science communication blog called Softbites, 
                where we set out to explain soft matter physics papers to students at an early undergraduate physics level. 
                I served as managing editor of Softbites for several years, where I was responsible for guiding pieces through our editorial process, 
                as well as editing many pieces myself, and occasionally, writing my own pieces. 
                I went on to lead several semester-long science communication workshops at Harvard that focused on story-telling. 
                Later, I was invited to write an article for the magazine, <i>Physics Today</i>, which you’ll find linked below. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Here is a selection of articles I've written, as well as a "science as art" project I did for fun.
