                Understanding human collective behavior—the large-scale patterns and trends that emerge when many people
                interact—may be the key to learning why some groups are able to effectively collaborate and coordinate 
                their members while others fail to achieve their goals. Researchers in complexity science have primarily 
                used simplified mechanistic models to explain certain sets of these emergent behaviors. However, 
                humans have complex cognition and path-dependent decision-making processes, so these models are often 
                insufficient for reproducing behavior observed in data. In this project, we plan to use AI to 
                identify patterns in data from online communities and use these observations to build new AI 
                architectures informed by the hypothesized mechanisms driving behavior, providing a new way to
                understand the collective behaviors found in large groups of natural minds. This proposed work is the 
                subject of a recent grant proposal.
